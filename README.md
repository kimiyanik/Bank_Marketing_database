# Bank_Marketing_database

This is a project I did as a part of my Datacamp Data Analysis course. The aim of this project is to clean and store the data of the recent marketing campaign of a bank (to get customers to take out a personal loan). The bank wants to conduct more marketing campaigns and thez need a database to store the campaigns' data so we need to design a schema so in future the data can be easily imported. 
Steps:
1. In this project first I used Python and pandas to transform the tables and columns to the required format needed by bank. This included reading csv files, reaming the columns, and subseting the dataframes.
2. Export the CSV files created from the previous step
3. Create a SQL query to create each of the tables for future use so they can create table and import data easily for next campaigns.
