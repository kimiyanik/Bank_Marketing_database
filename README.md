# Bank_Marketing_database

This is a project I did as a part of my Datacamp Data Analysis course. The aim of this project is to clean and store the data of the recent marketing campaign of a bank (to get customers to take out a personal loan). The bank wants to conduct more marketing campaigns and they need a database to store the campaigns' data so we need to design a schema so in future the data can be easily imported. 
Steps:
1. In this project first I used Python and pandas to transform the tables and columns to the required format needed by bank. This included reading csv files, renaming the columns, and subseting the dataframes.
2. I exported the CSV files created from the previous step.
3. I created a SQL query to create each of the tables for future use so they can create table and import data easily for next campaigns.
